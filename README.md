## 🤖 AI & Learning Transparency
**This project is a key milestone in my transition from Medical Analysis to IT (#FromPipetteToPython).**

While the **medical logic, validation, and domain knowledge** (15 years of experience) are mine, the **code architecture and Python syntax** were developed with the active assistance of **Google Gemini** (acting as my virtual Mentor & Architect).

* **My Goal:** To master Python Data Structures (Dictionaries, Loops) and Clean Code principles.
* **The Process:** I design the logic based on laboratory needs -> AI suggests the syntax -> I verify and implement.

## 🎯 About The Project
In medical diagnostics, shifting between **Conventional Units** (mg/dL, ng/mL) and **SI Units** (mmol/L, pmol/L) is a daily struggle. This tool automates the process using a massive database of conversion factors based on:

* **Tietz Clinical Guide to Laboratory Tests**
* **SI Unit International Standards**
* **Real-world protocols** (based on major Laboratory Networks like *Medyk* & *Diagnostyka*).

### ⚡ Key Features
* **Database of 150+ Parameters:** Covers Biochemistry, Hormones, Tumor Markers, Drugs (TDM), and Toxicology.
* **Smart Search Engine:** Just type "Gluc" or "TSH" to find the test instantly.
* **Categorized Browsing:** Organized into logical modules (e.g., *Cardiac Markers*, *24h Urine Collection*).
* **Context Aware:** Different conversion factors for Urine vs Serum.
* **Educational Warnings:** Highlights complex calculations (e.g., HbA1c conversion formulas).

## 🚀 How to Run
This tool is written in **Pure Python**. No external libraries (`pip install`) are required.

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download `main.py`):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MatthewJakubowski/Universal-Lab-Converter.git](https://github.com/MatthewJakubowski/Universal-Lab-Converter.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Universal-Lab-Converter
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### ⚠️ Medical Disclaimer

*This software is for educational and informational purposes only. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of conversion factors (based on Tietz/SI standards), it should NOT be used for clinical decision-making without verification. Always rely on your validated Laboratory Information System (LIMS).*
